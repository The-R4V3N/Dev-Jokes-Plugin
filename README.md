## Welcome! Glad to see you here  

The Dev Jokes WordPress plugin is the first plugin developed by me, and provides a simple and fun way to add random programming-related jokes to your website.  Currently in development, the plugin features a curated list of clean jokes, and generates a new joke each time the page is loaded.

While the source of the jokes is fixed at the moment, future versions of the plugin may allow for customization and user-submitted jokes. In the meantime, enjoy the current selection of jokes, which have been hand-picked for their humor and relevance to the programming community.

Easy to install and use, the Dev Jokes plugin adds some personality and levity to your website's pages or posts. Whether you're a developer looking for a laugh or a website owner looking to engage your audience, the Dev Jokes plugin is a great addition to any site.
